  <h2><b>Background</b></h2>
  <br>
  <p>
  Qualitative methods have been the fundamental to natural science, as we make detailed observations on natural phenomena, analyse them and then put forward pertinent hypotheses to be tested. As the field grows quantitative tools have been indispensable in our understanding on the natural world: dynamical models are used to recapitulate the behaviour of genes, individuals, populations, enzymatic reactions, etc. Next-generation sequencing has become a staple of many experimental settings, only made possible by the use of bioinformatics and big data analytics. In this workshop we will explore the different ways in which quantitative science from fields such as physics, mathematics and computer science have fused with biology in order to further advance scientific developments. This workshop is organised by PhD students and wishes to encourage the interchange of ideas from people with different approaches and different questions, who nonetheless develop or apply quantitative tools in biological problems.
