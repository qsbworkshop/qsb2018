I am interested in how to program computation and decision-making in biological systems. The applications of programmed biology are numerous, including the synthesis of medicines and industrial chemicals, through to the direct treatment of disease. I studied Mathematics at the University of Oxford, UK (2001-2005), before becoming a biologist at the University of Cambridge. My PhD project was a collaboration between Alex Webbâ€˜s group at the Department of Plant Sciences and Jorge Goncalves in the Control Group at the Department of Engineering. Following my PhD, I briefly held a research associate position in the Control Group, working with Glenn Vinnicombe on applications of stochastic control theory to gene networks. I came to Microsoft Research as a postdoc in 2009, during which I worked with Andrew Phillips on modelling immune systems and synthetic gene networks.

This requires computational methods ranging from quantum mechanical, through atomistic to mesoscale modelling.

He completed his PhD in Mathematics at the University of Oxford in 2011. His research demonstrates that mathematics can be used to describe all sorts of real-world phenomena: from embryo formation to locust swarming and from sleeping sickness to egg-shell patterning. He is particularly interested in the role that randomness plays in Biology. Some specific areas of work include cell migration, spatial hybrid simulation methods for reaction-diffusion systems and methodologies in stochastic simulations.

He is an expert in statistical methodologies for machine learning and data science and specialises in genomic science particularly cancer. His research ranges from mathematical and statistical algorithm development to collaborations with experimental scientists and clinicians involving modelling real world biomedical data sets. He leads a diverse group of researchers who specialise in both experimental and computational modelling and regularly gives talks and lectures around the world on data science. His goal is to conceive of a computational intelligence framework that will provide the foundation of learning health systems that will support novel health-related research from the molecular scale through to whole populations.
